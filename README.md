# prolog_code

Hopefully organized and reusable Prolog code.

1. Subdirectory `unpacked`: Contains the source code. Source code editing proceeds here-
1. Subdirectory `prepacked`: Contains a copy of the source code arranged such that "packing" can be done
1. Subdirectory `packed`: Contains the pack files (tar files)

Note that:

- This is mostly code specific to SWI-Prolog
- README files and Prolog code use [pldoc](https://eu.swi-prolog.org/pldoc/doc_for?object=section%28%27packages/pldoc.html%27%29) 
  markup, which is not fully compatible with github markdown. In particular, tables are not shown in github markdown, 
  so text may appear scrambled.

For information on packs, see:
